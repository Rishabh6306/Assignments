# PW Skills Assignments Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to the PW Skills Assignments Repository! This repository contains all the assignments we completed during our PW Skills course, where we explored and honed our skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each assignment is stored in a well-organized structure to help you navigate through our learning journey effectively.

## Folder Structure

All assignments are grouped in separate folders, named with the assignment title and submission date. This folder structure allows us to keep track of our progress and easily access specific assignments.

Within each assignment folder, you will find individual solutions for each question. We've sorted the solutions according to the question numbers, ensuring a systematic and coherent approach.

## Purpose

We created this repository for several essential reasons:

1. **Version Control:** By using Git, we can track changes made to each assignment, enabling us to review and manage our code efficiently.

2. **Progress Showcase:** The repository serves as a testament to our growth as developers. It showcases the skills we've acquired throughout our learning journey.

3. **Easy Access:** Having all assignments in one place provides us and our mentors with convenient access to review our work whenever necessary.

## Code Quality

Throughout our assignments, we prioritize writing clean, well-structured, and documented code. We understand the significance of maintaining code quality and always aim to follow best practices.

## Feedback

Feedback is a valuable aspect of our learning journey. If you have any suggestions or comments on how we can improve our solutions or code, please share them. Constructive feedback will help us enhance our skills and understanding.

Thank you for visiting our PW Skills Assignments Repository. We hope our work inspires and enriches your understanding as you explore the fascinating world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with us. Happy coding!
